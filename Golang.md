#Notes on Golang

## Starting points
- [ ] [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
- [ ] [How to write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html)
- [ ] [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- [ ] [Go's Declaration Syntax](https://blog.golang.org/gos-declaration-syntax)

## Stray observations
* Need to understand this $GOPATH variable
* Exported names in packages begin with a capital letter, unexported names are lowercase (unexported means inaccessible/private)
* For functions, type comes after variable name
* print type: `fmt.Printf("x is of type %T\n", x)`
